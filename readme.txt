## Why associate Space AND Time ?

On Earth, Human time is punctuated by several astral phenomena :
- the day and night cycles : ~24 hours (Earth's rotation, Earth lit by the Sun)
- the moon phases : ~29 days (Moon lit by the Sun, Moon visible from Earth at night)
- the 4 seasons : (3 months each, depending on the Earth's tilt and its position around the Sun)
  - 2 major seasons : 
    - Summer 
    - Winter
  - 2 "in-between" seasons : 
    - Spring : from Winter to Summer
    - Autumn : from Summer to Winter
